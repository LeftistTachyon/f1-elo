### _A stupidly simple F1 Elo system_

Inspired by [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U16a8tdrbII) and [this Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/developing-an-elo-based-data-driven-ranking-system-for-2v2-multiplayer-games-7689f7d42a53), I decided to try and make my own version of a Formula One Elo system.  
Data was taken from [the Ergast API](http://ergast.com/mrd/).
Shoutouts to the countless Stack Overflow questions that helped me make this a reality.

As of the time of writing (December 10th, 2023), these are the following rankings from the most recent revision of this algorithm:

If you want to see historical ratings, here you go (it's kinda shaky, MB):
